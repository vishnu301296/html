<h2>Introduction</h2>
<body>
Sports drinks, also known as electrolyte drinks, are functional beverages whose stated purpose is to help athletes replace water, electrolytes, and energy before, during and especially after training or competition, though their effects on performance in sports and exercise has been questioned.

At times if used too much, in wrong cases (as most of nutritional items) they may hinder health or performance. The drinks, or some of their ingredients, may not be suitable for certain conditions

<h2>Categories of sport drinks</h2>
<body>
Sports drinks can be split into three major types
<br>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Isotonic sport drinks contain similar concentrations of salt and sugar as in the human body.</li>
<li>Hypertonic sport drinks contain a higher concentration of salt and sugar than the human body.</li>
<li>Hypotonic sport drinks contain a lower concentration of salt and sugar than the human body.</li>
</ol>
<i>Most sports drinks are approximately isotonic, having between 4 and 5 heaped teaspoons of sugar per eight ounce (13 and 19 grams per 250ml) serving.</i>

<p>Athletes actively training and competing lose water and electrolytes by sweating, and expending energy. However, Robert Robergs, an exercise physiologist at the University of New Mexico who studied Gatorade, said that unless someone is exercising or competing in a sporting event for longer than 90 minutes, there is no reason to drink something with excess sugar and electrolytes. The Australian Institute of Sport states that excessive salt supplementation during exercise may lead to "gastrointestinal problems or cause further impairment of fluid balance" and may cause salt-induced cramps.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<body>
<p>In the 19th and early 20th centuries, athletes occasionally drank beer of low alcohol content replenishing water, minerals and energy in the body. As the water is boiled during the brewing process and thus sterilized, the beer was a safer option than water from an unknown source.</p>
<p> However, it is studied that even a low dose of ethanol decreases endurance performance: it inhibits liver glucose output during exercise, and also impairs psychomotor skills such as reaction time, hand-eye coordination and balance.</p>
